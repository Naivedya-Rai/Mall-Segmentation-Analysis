This project involves the analysis of the Mall Customer Dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about customers, including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The primary goal of this analysis is to perform customer segmentation to understand different customer groups and their behaviors.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 200 entries with 5 columns:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

Here's a brief summary of the dataset statistics:

- Number of Rows: 200
- Number of Columns: 5

## Data Analysis

The analysis begins with data exploration, visualization, and clustering using K-Means:

1. Data Exploration: The dataset's structure and characteristics are explored, including the distribution of customer demographics such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

2. Clustering: K-Means clustering is performed to segment customers into different groups based on annual income and spending score. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the "Elbow Method" and "Silhouette Score."

3. Visualizations: The results of the clustering analysis are visualized using scatter plots and bar charts to understand the distribution of customers in different clusters.

## Conclusion

The Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis successfully identifies customer segments within the dataset based on annual income and spending score. The analysis provides insights into customer behavior and preferences, which can be valuable for marketing and business strategies.
